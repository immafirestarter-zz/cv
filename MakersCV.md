# Sami Mason

I am a Biosciences graduate who has decided to switch career path and pursue something I am passionate about in coding, with help from Makers Academy. I have a master's degree in research, as well as having consulted small, scientific businesses with their intellectual property. I want to apply these skills I have acquired (notably the ability to research and solve problems effectively) to the world of coding, helping to fix broken code and create my own original code.

I'm looking for a junior developer role in a company that can make productive use of my skillset while teaching me more about development.


## Skills

### Research

In most of my previous positions in academia and the workplace, research has been one of the most necessary skills that I have had to employ. Whether it be searching through incredibly similar scientific papers for small details to add to my ever expanding dissertation, or reading through patents to find any means of exploiting or protecting (depending on which side I was on) the respective invention. If you want an example of some of my research aiding in some cool (in my opinion) neuroscience discoveries, click here: (link to published paper will go here (when my supervisor decides to publish)).

Research is important in almost all levels of employment, but especially so in a field such as coding, where you are always trying to find new ways to refactor your code. With a language such as Ruby, there are so many different ways of achieving the same result, and researching better ways of doing things is almost as integral as writing the correct code in the first place.

### Communication

Throughout my career so far I have almost always been in an environment where communication is essential. In the lab it is important to collaborate with your fellow scientists in order to make discoveries quicker and ensure all projects go smoothly and efficiently (and in my case communication was also useful for breaking any monotony that resulted from repetitive experiments).

This skill helps me integrate quickly into any new situation I am thrust into, and allows me to adapt to my surroundings. I quickly pick up information that is given to me, and am not hesitant to ask questions if I am stuck. I am easy-going and quickly familiarise myself with the people around me, making it more comfortable when working with others as part of a team. In a field where pair-programming plays an important part, I think such skills are invaluable.

### Dedication

Once I have committed to something, I am always inclined to follow it through, no matter what. Halfway through my master's degree I realised that I hated my project and the work that went with it. Despite this I persevered and ended up with an honours degree that I was proud of. I met some great people along the way and felt good about my self upon completetion. The same applied to high school; I hated my first few years but kept going and eventually became a better person for it.

This new chapter in my life presents exciting prospects and new opportunities, as coding is something that I have always been intrigued by and wanted to try. I know that I will give my all at any developer position I am given, and I am not someone who will let you down.
