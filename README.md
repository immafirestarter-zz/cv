# Sami Mason

I am a Biosciences graduate who has decided to switch career path and pursue something I am passionate about in coding, with help from Makers Academy. I have a master's degree in research, as well as having consulted small, scientific businesses with their intellectual property. I would like to combine these skills I have acquired (notably the ability to research and solve problems effectively) to the world of developement, helping to refactor existing code and create my own original code.

I'm looking for a junior developer role in a company that can make productive use of my skillset while teaching me more about software development and the principles that go with it.


## Skills

### Research

In my previous positions in academia and the workplace, research has been one of the key skills that I have had to employ. Whether it be searching through similar scientific papers for small details or reading through patents to find means of exploiting or protecting (depending on which side I was on) the respective invention.

Research is important in almost all levels of employment, but especially so in a field such as coding, where you are always trying to find new ways to refactor. Throughout my time at Makers, where pair programming is emphasised, the ability to research information correctly has proven invaluable; aiding me in solving many problems that I had.

### Communication

I have often been in an environment where communication is essential. In the lab it is important to collaborate with your fellow scientists in order to make quicker discoveries and ensure all projects go smoothly and efficiently (communication was also useful in breaking any monotony that resulted from repetitive experiments). At Makers, this skill was important as constant communication with your pair partner is integral to well written code and a fulfilling learning experience.

This skill helps me integrate quickly into any new situation I am thrust into, and allows me to adapt to my surroundings. I quickly pick up information that is given to me, and am not hesitant to ask questions if I am stuck. I am easy-going and quickly familiarise myself with the people around me, making it more comfortable when working with others as part of a team.

### Dedication

Once I have committed to something, I am always inclined to follow it through, no matter what. Halfway through my master's degree I realised that I hated my project and the work that went with it. Despite this I persevered and ended up with an honours degree that I was proud of. I met some great people along the way and felt good about my self upon completion. The same applied to secondary school; I hated my first few years but kept going and eventually became a better person for it.

At Makers, such dedication was in evidence during the group projects, especially in our final project which involved creating a 2D platformer in swift. We really wanted to create a well polished game that we would be able to proudly present on graduation day. What we ended up with was probably better than any of us could have imagined, but inv. I know that I would do the same at any developer position I am given, and I am not someone who will let you down.
